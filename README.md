# ZenTransfer for Mac and Windows

ZenTransfer is a *free* file transfer utility for professional photographers.

It runs on Mac OS (Apple Silicon) and Windows.
(It may run on Intel Mac's, but I don't have one to test.)

It can:

* Empty SD-Cards and ensure 3-2-1 Backup
* Organize files into folders by date
* Upload files to AWS S3, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (OVH and Hetzner coming)
* Monitor for new files on zentransfer.io and sync to your laptop
* Relay to multiple FTP Servers, Email, Webhooks and Zapier.com via ZenTransfer.io

The ZenTransfer app is free to use and works with or without an account on ZenTransfer.io.

## Current state

ZenTransfer is working, but in beta. It performs very well on the days when the
sun is shining and all the gods are happy (read: the internet works). I am now
checking to see if this concept is something people would like and appreciate, and
if so, I will continue working to add all the industry-grade features needed to ensure
it also works reliably when thunder and hail are sent by forces outside of our control. ;)

Plus there's a ton of features I would like to see, and I guess you can come up with some too.

## Support my work

I, Chris, am just an average photographer, but a (pretty good?) software engineer 
by training and trade. ZenTransfer is a hobby project to help a community I love.
You can support it by sharing and letting others know of ZenTransfer, by donating,
or by subscribing to the zentransfer.io service. This way I can ensure there's
coffee in my cup to keep me going through weekends and long, dark, winter nights
here in Norway. Then more and better code will be coming your way!

## How to send files from your camera with FTP

If you have a professional camera that supports FTP transfers, you can set up an 
account on https://zentransfer.io/ to get a cloud FTP server. When the camera
sends files you can relay them one or more destinations, and use this app to have
them synced instantly to your laptop.

## Contributing

This app is changing a lot as I am implementing the features on the current backlog, and
the codebase is not stable enough to facilitate wide collaboration quite yet. Electron
developers know how to find the code - have fun with it. Others may contribute by
sharing, testing and filing issues, and helping in the reddit community. I'll open
up for more collaboration as things get a bit more stable. [See the blog on contribution
for more information](https://zentransfer.io/blog/contribute-to-zentransfer).
