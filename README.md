# ZenTransfer for Mac and Windows

ZenTransfer is a *free* file transfer utility for professional photographers.

It runs on Mac OS (Apple Silicon) and Windows.

It can:

* Empty SD-Cards and ensure 3-2-1 Backup
* Organize files into folders by date
* Upload files to AWS S3, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (OVH and Hetzner coming)
* Monitor for new files on zentransfer.io and sync to your laptop
* Relay to FTP Servers, Email, Webhooks and Zapier.com via ZenTransfer.io

The ZenTransfer app is free to use and works with or without an account on ZenTransfer.io.

## How to send files from your camera with FTP

If you have a professional camera that supports FTP transfers, you can set up an 
account on https://zentransfer.io/ to get a cloud FTP server. When the camera
sends files you can relay them one or more destinations, and use this app to have
them synced instantly to your laptop.

## Current state

ZenTransfer is working, but in beta. It performs very well on the days when the
sun is shining and all the gods are happy (read: the internet works). I am now
checking to see if this concept is something people would like and appreciate, and
if so, I will continue working to add all the industry-grade features needed to ensure
it also works reliably when thunder and hail are sent by forces outside of our control. ;)

Plus there's a ton of features I would like to see, and I guess you can come up with some too.

## Support our work

I, Chris, am just an average photographer, but a pretty good software engineer 
(by training and trade). ZenTransfer is a hobby project to help a community I love.
You can support it by sharing and letting others know of ZenTransfer, by donating,
or by subscribing to the zentransfer.io service. This way I can ensure there's
coffee on the shelf to keep me going through weekends and long, dark, winter nights
here in Norway.
