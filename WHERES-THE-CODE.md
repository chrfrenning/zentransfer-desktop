# But... where's the code?

This project is very, very early and I'm gathering user feedback, and I'm not ready for PRs quite yet.

I have to prioritize very limited time, and I've invested that in making installers for both MacOS and Windows so this app can benefit as many people as possible (after all, most of the photographers out there are photographers, not coders, and prefer installers).

ZenTransfer is an Electron app, so you can find all the source in the bundle.

I am working on packaging up all the code and separating my build process/secrets/etc/etc/etc. Give me some cycles and everything will magically appear here - ready for pulls, forks, PRs, and issues.
